This is a test on a real time CPU Based 2D Eularian Fluid simulation. 
<br>I test out different advection schemes including: 
  - Semi Lagrangian 
  - BFECC 
  - Modified MacCormack. 
  
<br>I utilize the Gauss-Seidel Pressure projection to solve incompressability. 

You can paint the density to begin the simulation. The program comes with a source advection at bottom of the screen as well as seen from the image above.

The program also has the ability to plug in your own image to advect color as seen below
